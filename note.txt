The sprintf() function in PHP returns a formatted string using placeholders. It allows you to format numbers, strings, and other values into a specific output. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
$name = "John";
$age = 25;
echo sprintf("My name is %s and I am %d years old.", $name, $age);
// Outputs: My name is John and I am 25 years old.
In this case:

%s is a placeholder for a string.
%d is a placeholder for an integer.

The strip_tags() function in PHP removes HTML and PHP tags from a string. This is useful for cleaning input or output to ensure that no unwanted tags or scripts are rendered.
